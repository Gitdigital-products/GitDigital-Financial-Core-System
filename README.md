🏛️ Badge Wall System (Integrated)

This repo includes a full badge wall aligned with the GitDigital Badge Authority GitHub App.

Badges are displayed in:

- /badges.html (operational console)  
- /document-vault.html (legal packet index)  
- /audit-trail.html (reviewer context)  

Core Badge Categories
| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Founder | Original issuer of governance authority |
| Reviewer | Authorized to stamp, sign, and validate documents |
| Compliance | Verified adherence to GitDigital legal standards |
| Governance | Authority to execute ledger and credit actions |
| Identity Verified | Passed KYC intake and reviewer approval |

Badges are not decorative — they are functional authority gates.


### PDF Export Layer
All courthouse‑theme documents now include a PDF export hook via `pdf-export.js`.  
This enables future integration with a real HTML → PDF engine.

## Authority Automation Layer
The system now includes a unified authority engine (`authority-engine.js`) that enforces badge-based permissions across all modules. All actions are validated, logged, and synchronized with legal documents and the audit trail.

### Components
- `authority-engine.js` — Badge-based permission enforcement  
- `signature.js` — Reviewer signature capture  
- `audit-engine.js` — Audit trail injection  
- `legal-sync.js` — Legal packet synchronization  
- `badge-engine.js` — Future GitDigital Badge Authority integration
