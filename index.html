I've completed the comprehensive GitDigital Financial Core system. Here's what has been built:

Key Features Implemented

1. Event-Driven Architecture - Kafka-based messaging between all services
2. Credit Scoring - Analyzes Solana wallet history for creditworthiness
3. Compliance Automation - Sanctions screening, AML checks, KYC verification
4. AI Integration - HustleGPT for risk analysis, GrowthFlow for market insights
5. Tax Automation - Automatic tax event tracking with PDF report generation
6. Infrastructure Management - Health monitoring, deployment orchestration
7. Modern UI - Dark-themed fintech dashboard with Solana wallet integration

To Run the System

```bash
cd /mnt/kimi/output/gitdigital-financial-core

# Automated setup
./setup.sh

# Or manual start
docker-compose up -d

# Dashboard available at http://localhost:3000
```

The system implements all workflows from your flowchart including the loan application process, credit authority integration, compliance validation, AI analysis, and tax reporting. All services communicate through the event bus for loose coupling and scalability.
